# Large Protein Complex Analysis
This project is being done within the [Brown Lab](https://brown.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School during the summer of 2022 by BCMP Scholar Nicholas Shaw.
## What does this do?
The goal of this project is to develop a method to generate models of large protein complexes using [AlphaFold Multimer](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold). Running many large proteins in a single AlphaFold Multimer run is currently not possible for most scientist. This project aims to fill in this gap by running many small iterations of AlphaFold and then analyzing the likelihood of these protein-protein interactions occuring in nature.
## It's not done yet though, and I promise to clean up the code later.
