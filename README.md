# Large Protein Complex Analysis
This project is being done within the [Brown Lab](https://brown.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School during the 
summer of 2022 by Nicholas Shaw.
## What does this do?
The goal of this project is to develop a method to generate models of large protein complexes using 
[AlphaFold Multimer](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold). Running many large proteins in a single AlphaFold Multimer 
run is currently not possible for most scientist. This project aims to fill in this gap by running many small 
iterations of AlphaFold and then analyzing the likelihood of these protein-protein interactions occuring in nature.
## Status of project
This is very much still a work in progress. I will update this README with instructions on how to use once the central 
scripts are completed and working together. Currently, using the program requires commmenting out lines and making 
some directories by scratch.
